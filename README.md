# deep_learning_banking_customer_model
This model is used to predict whether or not a customer will leave the bank or not based on 6 months of data provided.

The project uses banking data, encodes it to normalized input, and passes it through an artificial neural network with two hidden layers with 6 nodes each. it then uses a sigmoid function at the output layer to predict whether the customer will stay with the bank or leave the bank, so the bank can choose to incentivize customers who may want to leave. This was part of a Udemy class.
